<h1>Exam Proctoring</h1>

<p>As part of our commitment to uphold academic integrity, this course uses <a href="https://smarterservices.com/smarterproctoring/students/">SmarterProctoring<a> for all online exams. SmarterProctoring is a flexible, online proctoring service that allows students to take exams remotely while ensuring the integrity of the exam process. To take exams with SmarterProctoring, you will need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a reliable high-speed internet connection,</li>
  <li>a webcam and microphone,</li>
  <li>a laptop or desktop computer (Mac, PC or Chromebook),</li>
  <li>a government-issued photo ID</li>
  <li>the SmarterProctoring Chrome Extension,</li>
  <li>an updated version of Google Chrome,</li>
  <li>and optionally at your professor’s discretion, you may be required to use your personal smartphone device as a secondary camera.</li>
</ul>

  <p>More specific information about how to navigate and take an exam with SmarterProctoring is available within your Canvas course.</p>

  <p>It is the responsibility of the Sanders College of Business and Technology to prepare and train students to be business professionals in the workforce. To this charge, know that online proctoring is a privilege – not a right – and we expect our students to always uphold professional standards throughout the online proctoring process. As a general rule, behaviors that your professor would not allow within a physical classroom during a traditional face-to-face exam will also not be allowed during online proctored exams. These behaviors include, but are not limited to the following:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Using your handheld device for anything other than a secondary camera,</li>
    <li>Using an improper secluded examination setting (sitting on a bed, lying under covers in bed, bathroom, etc.),</li>
    <li>Wearing improper attire or not being fully clothed (pajamas, hoodies, caps, hats, sunglasses, etc.),</li>
    <li>Eating, drinking, chewing gum, etc.,</li>
    <li>Wearing headphones, earplugs/earbuds, smartwatches, augmented reality smart glasses, etc.,</li>
    <li>Watching television, listening to music, listening to podcasts, etc.,</li>
    <li>Talking, including verbally reading questions and answers aloud to yourself.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong><em>Disclaimer: It is mentioned below that if you take a “Record and Review” exam and have multiple exam rule violations, that your instructor may ask you to take remaining exams via a “Live Proctor” or at a “Certified Testing Center.” Keep in mind that your instructor also reserves the right to enforce additional penalties (failing grade on exam, failing grade for course, etc.), in accordance with their specific course policy and the University’s Academic Honesty Policy. </em></strong></p>

  <h3>“Record and Review” Exams</h3>
  <p><em>There is no cost to the student for taking a “Record and Review” exam.</em></p>
  <p>The primary method for taking online exams will be the “Record and Review” method, where your entire exam session will be recorded and then reviewed afterward by a trained proctor. SmarterProctoring will take you through an identity verification process and will then record both your webcam/microphone and your computer screen throughout the exam. A trained proctor will then watch the exam video and flag suspected exam rule violations. After completing the video review, SmarterProctoring will send an incident report to your instructor and your instructor will watch the videos in which rule violations occur. If warranted, your instructor will contact you directly to discuss penalties for rule violations.</p>

  <h3>“Live Proctored” Exams</h3>
  <p><em>There is no cost to the student for taking a “Live Proctored” exam.</em></p>
  <p>If you have an exam flagged for violating the Exam Rules for a course, your instructor may ask you to take all remaining exams in the course with a trained Live Proctor from SmarterProctoring. This will require to you to schedule your exam 48-hours in advance of when you plan to take it, to ensure a live proctor is available for your exam session. The live proctor will verify your identity and watch your entire exam session in real-time, verifying that all exam rules are being followed throughout the exam.</p>

  <h3>“Certified Testing Center” Exams</h3>
  <p><em>There may be costs associated with taking exams in a certified testing center. The Sanders College of Business & Technology (COBT) pays SmarterProctoring $25 per exam per student. If you choose to take your exam at a certified testing center that charges $25 or less for exams, then the Sanders COBT will cover that cost and there will be no cost to you for taking the exam. However, if you choose to take your exam at a certified testing center that charges more than $25, then the Sanders COBT will still pay the $25 but you will be responsible for paying the difference. For example, if the testing center charges $30 for an exam, then the COBT will pay $25 and you will be required to pay the $5 difference to take the exam.</em></p>
  <p>You may choose to take exams in this course in a Certified Testing Center (available across the U.S.) if you prefer that type of testing environment rather than being proctored online. Your instructor also has the right to send you to a certified testing center for exams if the SmarterProctoring incident reports show an abundance of exam rule violations. This will require you to schedule an exam session 48-hours in advance of when you plan to take it, and then you will drive to the testing center to take your exam in person with a live proctor in the testing center with you.</p>
